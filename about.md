My name is Xiaoxiao Wang. I'm a data scientist living in the Bay Area. Before that I had my Ph.D. in particle physics, working on the [ATLAS Experiment](http://atlasexperiment.org/comics4.html)
<!--
(http://atlas.cern/)
--> at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://xkcd.com/401/) and searching for [Supersymmetric particles](https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/).

I'm passionate about both the analytical and engineering aspects of data science. I'm also a strong believer of using data to truly improve people's lives and make our world a better place.

I like hiking, playing basketball, and learning about cool things in science and technology. I'm a big fan of *The Big Bang Theory*. Bazinga!
