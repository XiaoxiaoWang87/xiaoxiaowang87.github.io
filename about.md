Welcome to my website!

My name is Xiaoxiao Wang. I'm a data scientist working and living in the Bay Area. Before that I had my Ph.D. in particle physics, working on the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider and searching for supersymmetric particles.

I'm passionate about both the analytical and engineering aspects of data science. I'm also a strong believer of using data to truly improve people's lives and make our world a better place.

In my spare time, I like hiking, playing basketball, and learning about any new and cool things in science and technology. I'm also a big fan of *The Big Bang Theory*. Bazinga!
