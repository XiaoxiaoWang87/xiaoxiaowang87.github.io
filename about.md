Welcome to my website!

I'm a data scientist working and living in the Bay Area. Before that I had my Ph.D. in physics, working on the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.

I enjoy both the analytical and engineering aspects of data science. Ultimately I hope I can use data to truly benefit people's lives.

I like hiking, playing basketball, and I'm also a big fan of *The Big Bang Theory*.
