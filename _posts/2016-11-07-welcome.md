I like reading blogs about data and statistics. Many of them are fun, inspirational, and teach me things that are directly applicable. So I started asking myself: can I start one too?

I haven't fully decided what to write yet. But once in a while I do want to share some of my thoughts in doing data analyses, or pitfalls that I've encountered and believe can be avoided. I'm not a statistician or a computer scientist, but hopefully my physics background can provide a slightly different angle when talking about these issues.

This blog is called *Uncertainties*, mainly because I think estimating and reducing uncertainties are an integral part of any data analyses. I want to remind myself to pay attention to these things as well.

I'm very excited about what I will write about in the coming days and months!
