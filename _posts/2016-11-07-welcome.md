I plan to use this blog to share some of my thoughts on doing data analyses. I'm not a statistician or a computer scientist by training, but hopefully my physics background can provide a slightly different angle for these discussions.

This blog is called *Uncertainties*, as I think estimating and reducing uncertainties are the most essential part (and the hardest part) of a data analysis. They deserve more attention from us.

I'm very excited about what I may write in the coming days and months!
