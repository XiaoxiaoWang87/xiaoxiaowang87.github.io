I like reading blogs about data and statistics! Many of them are fun and inspiring. Quite often, they also teach me things that are directly applicable. So I started asking myself: can I start one too?

I haven't completely decided what to write yet. But once in a while I do want to share some of my thoughts on doing data analyses, or pitfalls I've encountered and believe can be avoided. I'm not a statistician or a computer scientist by training, but hopefully my physics background will provide a different angle when talking about these issues.

This blog is called *Uncertainties*, mainly because I think estimating and reducing uncertainties are essential for any type of data analyses or discussions. But their importance is often ignored. I want to remind myself to pay attention to these things.

I'm very excited about what I may write in the coming days and months!
