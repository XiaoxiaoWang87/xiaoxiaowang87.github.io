Reading blogs about data and statistics is fun, and I always wanted to start a blog myself.

Perhaps once in a while I will share some of my thoughts on doing data analyses, or pitfalls I've encountered and believe can be avoided. I'm not a statistician or a computer scientist by training, but I hope my physics background will provide a different angle when talking about these issues.

I call this blog *Uncertainties*, because I think estimating and reducing uncertainties are essential for a data analysis. They deserve more attention from us.

I'm very excited about what I may write in the coming days and months!
