Over the last weekend I did a DIY project -- building my own computer. I'm now super excited to see that everything has finished and worked out well. I've encountered a few technical problems, but eventually managed to solve them. Below are some notes about the process.

### Choosing Components

My whole project started mainly because of reading this awesome article "[**Build a super fast deep learning machine for under $1,000**](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/build-a-super-fast-deep-learning-machine-for-under-1000)". It had an excellent section introducing different parts of a computer and choices the author has made (and tested). My life would have been much harder had I not read this article. So I recommend it to anyone who wants to build a PC from scratch.

All I did later was tweaking the choices of different parts to better accommodate my need. Other than checking the specification and compatibility of each product on their official website, I made my decisions primarily based on Amazon reviews. Below is a summary of my choices.

| Component     | Model |  Price |
| ------------- |:------| ------:|
| Motherboard   |[ASUS Z170-A ATX DDR4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012NH05UW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) | $145 |
| CPU           |[Intel Core i5 6600K 3.50 GHz](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012M8M7TY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  |    $236 |
| RAM           |[Corsair Vengeance 64GB (4x16GB) DDR4 3000](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HKF3TXM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |   $465   |
| GPU           |[Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1060 6G](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JNUO6BG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)      |     $255 |
| Hard Drive    |[WD Blue 1TB SATA](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  |  $50 |
| Power Supply  |[Cooler Master G650M](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MAZK6IO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |    $84 |
| Heat Sink     |[Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005O65JXI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |     $32 |
| Case          |[Cooler Master N400 - Mid Tower](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DKXXBU0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |     $50 |
| Total         |       |     $1,317 |

I went over $1,000 mainly because I bought the 64GB RAM as opposed to the 8GB one. Despite that RAM has gotten cheaper over the years, it is still one of the most expensive parts of a computer.


#### Notes:
  * I did not choose the [ASUS Mini ITX DDR4 LGA 1151 B150I PRO GAMING](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/B150I-PRO-GAMING-WIFI-AURA/) motherboard because it only supports up to 32GB of RAM and one GPU. Eventually I decided on Z170-A which supports up to 64GB of RAM and multi-GPUs.

  * I definitely want to build this computer to support my common data analysis and machine learning tasks, without having to pay Amazon a ton of money to use AWS. Tasks like feature engineering, for example, can cost a lot of memory if done on a non-distributed system. If one often does quick analyses in Pandas, it is hard to process any dataset with bigger than 1,000,000 rows and thousands of columns on a 32GB machine. There are walkarounds like [SFrame](https://github.com/turi-code/SFrame) which significantly reduces RAM pressure by doing out-of-core processing and using more disk space. But even so I do not want to be constantly bothered by worrying about my RAM.  


### Assembling Everything

I've checked out a couple of instruction videos made by different persons on Youtube. But eventually I followed along the following ones. It was mainly because this guy used the exact motherboard as I did (ASUS Z170-A). If you had chosen a different motherboard, you may want to look for something else. But I would say major steps are all the same.

The other thing I like about this guy other than he explains things well is that whenever he finds something he thinks useless (like the plastic CPU installation tool), he just tosses it away or straight onto the floor! I find it funny but in fact like this attitude toward assembling things like a computer -- do not follow the user manual line-by-line or be afraid of breaking things.  

#### Notes:  
  * My computer did not boot the first time I tried. The green motherboard light was on, but nothing else was responsive. I wasn't sure whether it's because I got a bad motherboard or anything else, so I started debugging by unplugging all connectors on the motherboard (except its power), and taking the graphic card out as well. After all these work the motherboard had a single beep when I pressed the power button. Looks like it now started powering up.

  * Then I plugged cables back to the motherboard one by one, and realized that the initial failure was because I connected the case fan to both the motherboard and power supply, causing a short-circuit. It turned out that this could be quite dangerous. There was once when I had the power supply on and was trying to connect the fan to the power supply (while the other side of the fan was still connected to the motherboard). I immediately heard a very sharp electric-shock sound and the computer shut off automatically. Luckily, my motherboard was not destroyed. So always remember to turn off the power supply before connecting anything else to it.

  * Now it looked like the motherboard was responsive, and the fans were running. However there was still no display on my screen, and the RAM light was red. It turned out that both were due to the same reason -- the memory sticks did not get mounted tightly enough. I realized this by re-mounting the RAM stick one by one and re-starting the computer every time I installed a new RAM stick. My computer officially came to life after the first RAM stick got properly installed. That was a very exciting moment!  



### Installing OS and GPU Driver

#### Notes:
  * To install Ubuntu I used a USB that had the Ubuntu ISO file burned in. Here are some [instructions](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos). Before doing that I had to format my USB to FAT32 first (mine was exFAT initially).

  * To properly use GPU and to have a better display resolution on the screen, we need to install the GPU driver. NVDIA has a [website](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) that helped me to decide which driver version is compatible with my GTX 1060 GPU. For me that was version 375. To install it, I did:
  ```
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install nvidia-375
  ```
  However, after doing this and rebooting my system, I found I was no longer be able to log-in. I struggled for a while to look for answers. Clearly, one way to log-in was to delete the NVDIA driver completely by doing:
  ```
  Press Ctrl + Alt + F1
  sudo apt-get purge nvidia-*
  ```
  But the point is we want to have the driver installed and also be able to log-in correctly. After spending a few extra hours and almost trying everything on the Internet, I finally found a way out:

    * Go to the BIOS mode, under the Secure Boot menu, select "Other OS" (for me the default setting there was Windows..).

    I'm not quite sure why this simple fix solved my problem, but it did work for me.

### Installing CUDA, CUdNN, and Testing Tensorflow Performance

Now I'm very curious about how well my PC can do in terms of computing. With all the hype around deep learning and how amazing its performance is on GPU, I want to test it out myself. Before doing this, there are still two things to install: CUDA and CUdNN. CUDA lets other applications (like Tensorflow) to use GPU and CUdNN speeds things up specifically for deep neural nets.

#### Notes:
  * **Install CUDA:** First I downloaded the CUDA Toolkit 8.0 (lastest version) runfile from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). Then, I ran:
  ```
  sudo sh cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run
  ```
  However, this gave me an error saying my GCC version is not supported. I realized my Ubuntu 16.04 has its default GCC version as 5.4.1. But CUDA 8.0 is only compatible with [up to GCC 5.3.1](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/#axzz4aU1UITRt). Eventually, I downgraded my GCC to 4.9, after which the installation worked.
  ```
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install gcc-4.9 g++-4.9
  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.9  
  sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
  ```
  I also skipped the GPU driver installation, which I had done already (can be checked via `nvidia-smi`).

  * **Install CUdNN:** For CUdNN, I first downloaded the latest version 5.1 for linux from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn). Then I did:
  ```
  tar xvzf cudnn-8.0-linux-x64-v5.1.tgz
  cd cuda
  sudo cp include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include
  sudo cp lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64
  sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*
  ```
  I also put the following lines into my .bashrc file, after which Tensorflow finally stopped complaining about an `ImportError: libcudart.so` error.
  ```
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64
  export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
  ```

  * **Tensorflow GPU vs. CPU**: After installing Tensorflow, I used a simple but handy [script](https://gist.github.com/3h4/f6e9cabbead201056c4705c2590d3d21#file-0-matrix-py) from this blog post "[**Introduction to TensorFlow — CPU vs GPU**](https://medium.com/@erikhallstrm/hello-world-tensorflow-649b15aed18c#.ipfyuf5a2)" and compared how fast a simple N$$\times$$N matrix multiplication runs using GPU or CPU (the Tensorflow document also shows how to switch between GPU and CPU [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/using_gpu)). Below is the result:
  ![_config.yml](/images/2017-03-01-build_a_pc/results.png)  
  I'm new to Tensorflow and have never explicitly computed anything using GPU before. So this result looks astonishing to me. For not-so-big matrices at least, the larger the matrix is, the better GPU performs compared to CPU. Running two 2000$$\times$$2000 matrix multiplication is almost 1000 times faster under GPU than CPU! This by no means represents the speed improvement one will observe when running a large neural network (for which I generally heard is about 10-20 times), but makes me interested enough to explore further.


### Summary

I'm very happy about the performance of my computer so far. It is definitely the most powerful computer I've ever owned, and it is much cheaper than a Macbook Pro. Here are some photos I took during the installation.
