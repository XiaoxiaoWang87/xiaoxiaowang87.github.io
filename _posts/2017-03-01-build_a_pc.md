Over the last weekend I did a DIY project -- build my own computer. Now I'm super excited to see that everything has finished and worked out well. I've encountered a few technical problems, but eventually managed to solve them. Here are some notes about the process:

### Choosing Components

My whole project actually started because of reading the article [Build a super fast deep learning machine for under $1,000](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/build-a-super-fast-deep-learning-machine-for-under-1000). It had an excellent section discussing different parts of a computer and the choices the author has made. My life would have been much harder had I not read this article. So hats off to its author.

All I did later was tweaking the choices of different parts to accommodate my need. Other than checking the specifications of each product on the official website, I made my decision primarily based on Amazon reviews. Below is a summary of my choices and their prices.

| Components    | Model |  Price |
| ------------- |:------| ------:|
| Motherboard   |[ASUS Z170-A ATX DDR4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012NH05UW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) | $145 |
| CPU           |[Intel Core i5 6600K 3.50 GHz](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012M8M7TY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  |    $236 |
| RAM           |[Corsair Vengeance 64GB (4x16GB) DDR4 3000](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HKF3TXM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |   $465   |
| GPU           |[Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1060 6G](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JNUO6BG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)      |     $255 |
| Hard Drive    |[WD Blue 1TB SATA](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  |  $50 |
| Power Supply  |[Cooler Master G650M](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MAZK6IO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |    $84 |
| Heat Sink     |[Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005O65JXI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |     $32 |
| Case          |[Cooler Master N400 - Mid Tower](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DKXXBU0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |     $50 |
| Total         |       |     $1,317 |

I went over $1,000 mainly because I bought 64GB RAM as opposed to 8GB in the article above. Despite that RAM has apparently gotten cheaper over the years, it is still one of the most expensive parts of a computer.

### Assembling Everything

I've checked out a couple of instruction videos made by different persons on Youtube. But eventually I followed along the following ones. It was mainly because this guy used the exact motherboard as I did (ASUS Z170-A). If you had a different choice of motherboard, you may want to look for something else. But I would say the overall steps are all the same.

The other thing I like about this guy other than he explains things well is that whenever he finds something that he thinks useless (like the CPU installation tool), he just tosses it away or onto the floor. I actually think this is the right attitude of assembling things like a computer -- do not try to read the user manual line-by-line and be afraid of breaking things.
