title: Building My Own PC

Over the last weekend I did a DIY project -- building my own computer. I'm now super excited to see that everything has finished and worked out well. I've encountered a few technical problems, but eventually managed to solve them. Below are some notes about the process.

### Choosing Components

My whole project started mainly because of reading this awesome article "[Build a super fast deep learning machine for under $1,000](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/build-a-super-fast-deep-learning-machine-for-under-1000)". It had an excellent section discussing different parts of a computer and the choices the author has made (and tested). My life would have been much harder had I not read this article. So I recommend it to anyone who wants to build a PC from scratch.

All I did later was tweaking the choices of different parts to accommodate my need. Other than checking the specifications of each product on their official website, I made my decisions primarily based on Amazon reviews. Below is a summary of my choices.

| Component     | Model |  Price |
| ------------- |:------| ------:|
| Motherboard   |[ASUS Z170-A ATX DDR4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012NH05UW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) | $145 |
| CPU           |[Intel Core i5 6600K 3.50 GHz](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012M8M7TY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  |    $236 |
| RAM           |[Corsair Vengeance 64GB (4x16GB) DDR4 3000](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HKF3TXM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |   $465   |
| GPU           |[Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1060 6G](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JNUO6BG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)      |     $255 |
| Hard Drive    |[WD Blue 1TB SATA](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  |  $50 |
| Power Supply  |[Cooler Master G650M](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MAZK6IO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |    $84 |
| Heat Sink     |[Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005O65JXI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |     $32 |
| Case          |[Cooler Master N400 - Mid Tower](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DKXXBU0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)       |     $50 |
| Total         |       |     $1,317 |

I went over $1,000 mainly because I bought the 64GB RAM as opposed to the 8GB one. Despite that RAM has gotten cheaper over the years, it is still one of the most expensive parts of a computer.


#### Notes:
  * Machine learning tasks especially feature engineering done on a non-distributed system can cost a lot of memory. If you often do analyses in Pandas, a dataset with 10,000,000 rows and thousands of columns will probably blow up all the 64GB RAM space. When you have a small RAM, an alternative is to use tools like [SFrame](https://github.com/turi-code/SFrame) which nicely mitigates the problem by doing out-of-core processing and uses more disk space instead.

  * The [ASUS Mini ITX DDR4 LGA 1151 B150I PRO GAMING](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/B150I-PRO-GAMING-WIFI-AURA/) motherboard only supports up to 32GB of RAM and one GPU. Eventually I decided on Z170-A which supports up to 64GB of RAM and multi-GPUs.


### Assembling Everything

I've checked out a couple of instruction videos made by different persons on Youtube. But eventually I followed along the following ones. It was mainly because this guy used the exact motherboard as I did (ASUS Z170-A). If you had a different choice of motherboard, you may want to look for something else. But I would say the overall steps are all the same.

The other thing I like about this guy other than he explains things well is that whenever he finds something that he thinks useless (like the CPU installation tool), he just tosses it away or straight onto the floor! I find this funny but actually think it is not a bad attitude of assembling things like a computer -- no need to follow the user manual line-by-line or be afraid of breaking things.  

#### Notes:  
  * My computer did not boot the first time I tried. The green light on the motherboard was on, but nothing else. I wasn't sure whether it's because I got a bad motherboard or anything, and I stared unplugging all the connectors on the motherboard (except its power), and took the graphic card out as well. After all these the motherboard had a single beep when I pressed the power button. Looks like at least it was not broken.

  * After plugging cables back to the motherboard one by one, I realized that the initial failure was because I connected the case fan to both the motherboard and power supply, causing a short-circuit. It turned out that this could be quite dangerous. Just a moment later I accidentally plugged the fan back to the power supply when the power was still on and the other side of the fan was still connected to motherboard. Suddenly I heard a loud electric shock. Luckily, my motherboard did not get destroyed. Always remember: turn off the power supply first before connecting any cable to it.

  * Now it looked like the motherboard was responding, and the fans were running. However there was still no display, and the RAM light was red. It turned out that these were both due to the same reason -- the memory sticks did not get mounted tightly enough. I solved this problem by re-mounting the RAM stick one by one and re-starting the computer every time I installed a RAM stick. My computer officially came to life after the first RAM stick got properly installed. That was indeed an exciting moment.   



### Installing OS and GPU Driver

#### Notes:
  * To install Ubuntu I used a USB that had the Ubuntu ISO file burned in. Here are some [instructions](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos). Before doing that I had to format my USB to FAT32 first (mine was exFAT initially).

  * To properly use GPU and to have a better display resolution we need to install the GPU driver. NVDIA has a [website](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) that helped me decide on what driver version is compatible with my GTX 1060 GPU (mine was 375). To install it, I did:
  ```
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install nvidia-375
  ```
  However, after doing this and rebooting my system, I found I was no longer be able to log-in. I struggled a long time here to look for answers. One way to log-in was to delete the NVDIA driver completely by doing:
  ```
  Press Ctrl + Alt + F1
  sudo apt-get purge nvidia-*
  ```
  But this is not the point. The point is we want to have the driver installed and also be able to log-in correctly. After spending several hours and almost trying everything on the Internet, I finally found a way out:

    * Go to the BIOS mode, under the Secure Boot menu, select "Other OS" (for me the default setting there was Windows..).

    I still don't understand why this worked it did work for me.


### Summary

I'm very happy about the performance of my computer so far. It is definitely the most powerful one out of all computers I ever owned. Here are some photos I took during the installation.
