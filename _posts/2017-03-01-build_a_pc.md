Over the last weekend I did a DIY project -- build my own computer. Now I'm super excited to see that everything has finished and worked out well. I've encountered a few technical problems, but eventually managed to solve them. Here are some notes about the process:

### Choosing Components

### Assembling Everything

I've checked out a couple of instruction videos made by different persons on Youtube. But eventually I followed along the following ones. It was mainly because this guy used the exact motherboard as I did (ASUS Z170-A). If you had a different choice of motherboard, you may want to look for something else. But I would say the overall steps are all the same.

The other thing I like about this guy other than he explains things well is that whenever he finds something that he thinks useless (like the CPU installation tool), he just tosses it away or onto the floor. I actually think this is the right attitude of assembling things like a computer -- do not try to read the user manual line-by-line and be afraid of breaking things.
