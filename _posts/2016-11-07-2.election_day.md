title: The errors of pre-election polls
comments: true

As I'm sitting in front of the TV and watching the election results rolling out, I decided to write a few words here. So far the battles have been extremely intense. In Florida, North Carolina, and New Hampshire, Clinton and Trump's differences are all within 1%. A few other states are also too close to call.

The pre-election polls have shown that on average Clinton led Trump by about 3%, which had even tightened to about 2% after FBI director James Comey's letter to Congress. Of course the pre-election polls do not necessarily reflect the final outcome of the election. One of my favorite websites [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) had a great discussion about this.

For example, their chart below shows that polls a week before the election historically have a 2% error on average. As the race of two candidates has become so close now, it is not surprising that this size of an error could swap the final ranking of the two.

There are three things about the pre-election polling error that I think worth summarizing:

**1. It is mainly dominated by systematic errors.**

Nate Silver pointed out [here](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-dont-ignore-the-polls-clinton-leads-but-its-a-close-race/) that the 14 fully post-Comey polls he used have a combined sample size of **23,032**, which yields a **0.6%** of **statistical error**. If we assume an average **2%** of total error, then the **systematic error** should be **> 1.9%**.

* What are systematic errors?

  In short, they are the **biases** of a measurement. They affect repeated measurements in the same way. They are not directly due to statistics of the data and can not be reduced by increasing the sample size. This is one of the first concepts you will encounter in a college physics course.

* Where do they come from?

  I have to say I'm by no means an election poll expert. But there are several sources of systematic errors in the pre-election polls that I can think of. Maybe some of the polls are inherently biased, whether because of their political standpoints or their sampling methodologies. In addition, an important source of uncertainties come from undecided voters who may have a last-minute swing. Also, some groups of population can have a low response rate and are not fully represented in the pre-election polls.

**2. Systematic errors of this year can be larger than usual.**

There are far more undecided voters this year than in 2012 when Obama won the presidency . This could potentially contribute a large error to the pre-election poll results.

A larger-than-normal error of course can help Clinton win a big margin, but given how tight the race is it can also put Trump to a lead.

**3. Systematic errors among states are usually correlated.**

One of the things I learned from reading the [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) blogs is that historically the polling errors among states are usually correlated. This means if one of the swing states which originally favored Clinton in the pre-election polls turned out to be supporting Trump, several other states could do the same in the end.

This is not hard to understand. If one of the candidates did a better job campaigning in the last minute, undecided voters across states could be influenced in a similar way.

Now is already 9pm PT. And the final result is still not out yet. Let's see who will win eventually.
