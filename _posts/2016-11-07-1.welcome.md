I've read many interesting blogs about data and statistics. They are fun, inspirational, and teach me things that are directly applicable. So I started asking myself: can I start one too?

I haven't fully decided what to write yet. But once in a while I do want to share some of my thoughts in doing data analyses, or pitfalls that I've encountered and believe can be avoided. I'm not a statistician or a computer scientist, but hopefully my physics background can provide a slightly different angle when talking about these issues.

I decided to call this blog *Uncertainties*, partly because I think estimating and reducing uncertainties are integral to a data analysis. So I want to remind myself to pay attention to these things as well.

I'm very excited about what I will write in the coming days and months!
