title: The errors in pre-election polls
comments: true

As I'm sitting in front of the TV and watching the election results unveiling, I decided to write a few words here. So far the battles have been extremely intense. In Florida, North Carolina, and New Hampshire, Clinton and Trump's differences are all within 1%. A few other states are also too close to call.

The pre-election polls have shown that on average Clinton led Trump by about 3%, which was tightened to ~2% after FBI director James Comey's letter to Congress. No matter how much we want them to, the pre-election polls do not necessarily reflect the final outcome of the election due to polling errors. One of my favorite websites [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) had an excellent discussion on this. [Their chart](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/) below shows that polls a week before the election historically have a 2% error on average. As the race of two candidates became so close, it is not surprising that this size of an error could swap their final ranking.

There are three things about the pre-election polling error that I think worth mentioning:

**1. It is mainly dominated by systematic errors.**

Nate Silver mentioned [here](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-dont-ignore-the-polls-clinton-leads-but-its-a-close-race/) that the 14 fully post-Comey polls he used have a combined sample size of **23,032**, which yields a **0.6%** of **statistical error**. If we assume an average **2%** of total error, then the **systematic error** should be **> 1.9%**.

* What are systematic errors?

  In short, they are the **biases** of a measurement. They affect repeated measurements in the same way. They are not directly due to statistics of the data and can not be reduced by increasing the sample size. This is one of the first concepts you will encounter in a college physics course.

* Where do they come from?

  There are several sources of systematic errors I can think of. Maybe some of the polls are inherently biased, whether because of their political standpoints or their sampling methodologies. In addition, an important source of uncertainties comes from undecided voters who may have a last-minute swing. Also, some groups of population may have a low response rate and are not fully represented in the pre-election polls.

**2. Systematic errors of this year can be larger than usual.**

There are [far more undecided voters this year](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-why-clintons-position-is-worse-than-obamas/) than in 2012 when Obama won the presidency. This could potentially contribute a large error to the pre-election poll results.

A larger-than-normal error of course can give Clinton a landslide victory, but given how tight the race is it can also put Trump to win.

**3. Systematic errors among states are usually correlated.**

One of the things I learned from reading [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) blogs is that historically the polling errors among states are usually correlated. This means if a swing state who originally favored Clinton in the pre-election polls turned out to support Trump in the end, other states in a similar position could do the same.

This is not hard to understand. If one of the candidates did a better job campaigning in the last minute or had less negative news, undecided voters across states could be influenced in a correlated way.

It's already 9pm PT now, but the final result is yet determined. Let's see who will eventually use the polling error to their advantage!
